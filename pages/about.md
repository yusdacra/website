## Bio

I mainly work with Rust and Nix. My main areas of interest are
embedded, operating systems and game development, although I'm open to
anything else as well. I work on the Rust ecosystem of the Harmony protocol,
working on a client, server and SDK. I also maintain and contribute to some
Nix related projects, and contribute to nixpkgs.

I also work with Flutter, C++ (mostly for Arduino), GDScript (for Godot Engine),
Kotlin (for my application's native Android needs that Flutter can't satisfy,
mostly backend). I have worked with C# and Unity for about 5 years.

+ I use a NixOS system, you can find all my configurations here:
