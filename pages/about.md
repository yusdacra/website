## Bio

I mainly work with Rust and Nix. My main areas of interest are
embedded, operating systems and game development, although I'm open to
anything else as well. I work on the Rust ecosystem of the Harmony protocol,
working on a client, server and SDK. I also maintain and contribute to some
Nix related projects, and contribute to nixpkgs.

I also sometimes work with Flutter, C++ (mostly for Arduino), GDScript (for Godot Engine),
Kotlin (for my application's native Android needs that Flutter can't satisfy,
mostly backend). I have also worked with Unity and C# before.

+ I use a NixOS system, you can find my configuration [here](https://github.com/yusdacra/nixos-config).
+ This site's source is available [here](https://gitlab.com/yusdacra/yusdacra.gitlab.io).
