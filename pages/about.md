## Bio

I mainly work with Rust and Nix. My main areas of interest are
embedded, operating systems and game development, although I'm open to
anything else as well. I also work with Flutter, C++ (mostly for Arduino), 
GDScript (for Godot Engine), Kotlin (for my application's native Android
needs that Flutter can't satisfy, mostly backend). I have worked with C# and Unity
for about 5 years.

+ I use a NixOS system, you can find all my configurations here:
