hello, i'm dusk!!
i like to do many different things, but perhaps mainly i want to create stuff to inspire others to create stuff. at least i'm convinced that's what i wanna do xD.
software is my means to that end! (it's what i'm most proficient with lol)

i'm also trying to learn:
- how to draw (for concept art mainly)
- modeling / texturing / sculpting (these i have more experience with!)
- playing (acoustic, later electric) guitar (have to practice actually...)

my hope is to make many video games, ideally do the majority of the work myself and as said before, have people be inspired by them.
which is, well, kinda hard it turns out. so that's gonna take a long time probably (lmao)...
you can see some of the stuff i deem "okay" on my [itch.io profile](https://yusdacra.itch.io/)
(although those are by no means the only stuff i have worked on, have a lot of incomplete stuff, or stuff i don't want to show :3)

software wise you can just look at my github and gitea account to see what i like to use (is linked on the home page)

i like and interact with way too many media, mostly video games (can you guess that i like video games), here are the ones that influenced me the most:
- all 07th expansion works (most notably when they cry)
- all Project Moon works
- outer wilds
- splatoon
- steins;gate
- kino no tabi
- serial experiments lain
- LISA the Painful / Joyful (and some of it's fangames)
- VA-11 Hall-A
- SCP antimemetic division tales (by qntm)
- pokemon (unova my beloved)

honorable mentions (i want more people to see these cause i love them too much not to list):
- mr. rainer's solve-it service
- [fireball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireball_(TV_series))
- SANABI
- opus: echo of starsong
- the red strings club
- q.u.q.
- bug fables
- haibane renmei
- project wingman
- gosick
- tomorrow won't come for those without ██████

you can also look at [my steam profile](https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198106829949/?all_games) for games i played, although not everything is there.

what else, i like robots a lot, maybe too much. want to become one.
i want to learn japanese (i'm failing hard).
i like to listen to music (shocker), check my [youtube music profile](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCE_r0yMNQhOWituywmOJgzA?si=7DTUV9PFqcKxJyl1) and my [last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/yusdacra) i guess to see a bit of what i listen to.

idk if you wanna know more just hit me up and i'll gladly nerd out, or if you want to play anything i may be open to it...
