## Bio

I love using Nix / NixOS for anything.
I like developing with Rust and Zig for my hobby or work projects.
My projects are on [my GitHub](https://github.com/yusdacra) and [my Gitea](https://git.gaze.systems/dusk).

I love playing (and making) video games. Also a massive Splatoon nerd.
You can find any game I develop [here on my itch.io page](https://yusdacra.itch.io/).
