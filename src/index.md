## Bio

I love using Nix / NixOS for any kind of purpose, but mainly for DevOps.
I also use Rust and Zig for my hobby or other more serious projects.

I work at [Platonic Systems](https://platonic.systems).

+ I use a NixOS system, you can [find my configuration here](https://git.gaze.systems/dusk/ark).
