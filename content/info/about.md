## Bio
I mainly work with Rust and Dart (with Flutter). My main areas of interest are
embedded, operating systems and game development, although I'm open to
anything else as well. I also work with C++ (mostly for Arduino), 
GDScript (for Godot Engine), Kotlin (for my application's native Android
needs that Flutter can't satisfy, mostly services stuff). I have worked with C# and Unity
for about 5 years.

+ I mainly use a NixOS system, you can find all my configurations here:
  - [My personal configuration files.](https://gitlab.com/yusdacra/nixos-config)
  - [Repo where I keep reusable configuration and packages.](https://gitlab.com/yusdacra/nix-exprs)
